# Fuse_spark_test_script

Check that fuse test net (spark) new block reward algorithm matches the expected value for validators and delegators by back testing across passed blocks.


Current assumptions (will fix later):

• The validators also become active the cycle after they stake

• The delegation amount doesn't change in a cycle

• No blocks are missed
